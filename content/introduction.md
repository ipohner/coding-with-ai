## What is a Large Language Model?

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence trained on
vast amounts of text data to predict and generate human-like text. At their
core, these models learn statistical patterns in language: given a sequence of
words (or better *tokens*: fragments of words, commas, and anything in text), 
they predict what comes next.

```
Input:  "def calculate_mean(numbers):"
         |
         v
   +-------------+
   |    LLM      |  (predicts next tokens based on patterns
   |             |   learned from billions of code examples)
   +-------------+
         |
         v
Output: "    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)"
```

When applied to code, LLMs benefit from the fact that programming languages are
highly structured and follow consistent patterns. The model doesn't "understand"
code in the way humans do, but it has learned enough patterns to generate
syntactically correct and often semantically meaningful code.

:::{callout} Key insight
LLMs are sophisticated pattern-matching systems, not reasoning engines. They
excel at common patterns but can confidently produce incorrect code for novel
or complex problems. **Always verify AI-generated code**.

:::{admonition} Richard Stallman's view on "AI"
:class: tip

"So I've come up with the term Pretend Intelligence. We could call it PI. And if we start saying this more often, we might help overcome this marketing hype campaign that wants people to trust those systems, and trust their lives and all their activities to the control of those systems and the big companies that develop and control them."

:::{admonition} Practitioner's perspective: Simon Willison
:class: tip


*"My current favorite mental model is to think of them as an over-confident
pair programming assistant who's lightning fast at looking things up, can
churn out relevant examples at a moment's notice and can execute on tedious
tasks without complaint.*

*Over-confident is important. They'll absolutely make mistakes—sometimes
subtle, sometimes huge. These mistakes can be deeply inhuman—if a human
collaborator hallucinated a non-existent library or method you would
instantly lose trust in them.*

*Don't fall into the trap of anthropomorphizing LLMs and assuming that
failures which would discredit a human should discredit the machine in the
same way."*

## How are code LLMs trained?

Training a code LLM involves two main phases:

### 1. Pre-training

The model is exposed to massive amounts of code (and often natural language)
to learn general programming patterns:

| Model | Training Data Size | Languages |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| StarCoder | 1 trillion tokens | 80+ languages |
| StarCoder2 | 3.3-4.3 trillion tokens | 600+ languages |
| CodeLlama | Llama 2 base + code | Multiple |
| GPT-4 / Claude | Undisclosed | Multiple |

During pre-training, the model learns:
- Syntax rules for various programming languages
- Common coding patterns and idioms
- Relationships between code and comments/documentation
- How different parts of a codebase relate to each other

### 2. Fine-tuning and instruction tuning

After pre-training, models are often further refined:

- **Fine-tuning**: Training on specific domains (e.g., scientific Python)
- **Instruction tuning**: Teaching the model to follow human instructions
- **RLHF** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback): Aligning outputs with human preferences


## Training cut-off dates matter

A crucial characteristic of any model is its **training cut-off date**—the
date at which training data collection stopped. For coding, this has direct
practical implications:

| Impact | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Unknown libraries | A library released after the cut-off won't be suggested |
| Breaking changes | Major API changes since cut-off produce outdated suggestions |
| Deprecated patterns | Old syntax or methods may still be recommended |
| Security updates | Known vulnerabilities patched after cut-off won't be reflected |

:::{callout} Key insight
The training cut-off date is sometimes not known. With chatbots, you can try asking the chatbot.
What makes it even more challenging is that some AI systems also have "tools" attached to them,
so they can fetch **some** up-to-date content, while mixing with what they have seen during
their training. This can be a total success, or total disaster. Pick a stable library, even if it
is a little bit older. TODO: add link to https://boringtechnology.club/
:::


**Practical implications:**
- Check model documentation for training cut-off dates
- Be skeptical of suggestions for rapidly-evolving libraries
- Provide recent documentation or examples in prompts when using newer tools
- Consider library stability as a factor in technology choices


## Open datasets for training code LLMs

Understanding what data models are trained on helps us understand their
capabilities and limitations.

:::{warning}
The summaries below were genrated with Claude. They need to be manually verified.
:::

### The Stack (BigCode Project)

[The Stack](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack) is a major open
dataset for training code models:

| Version | Size | Languages | Key Features |
|---------|------|-----------|--------------|
| v1 | 6.4 TB | 358 | Permissive licenses only |
| v2 | 67.5 TB | 600+ | Includes PRs, notebooks, docs |

**Important characteristics:**
- Only includes permissively-licensed code (MIT, Apache 2.0, etc.)
- Copyleft licenses (GPL) are excluded
- Provides an opt-out mechanism for developers who don't want their code included
- Built on the Software Heritage archive

:::{discussion}
**Why does training data matter?**

Consider these implications:
- Models may reproduce patterns from their training data, including bugs
- Code style and conventions reflect the average of the training set
- Rare languages or niche libraries may have poor coverage
- The model cannot know about code written after its training cutoff

## The landscape of AI coding tools

AI coding assistants come in many forms. Here's an overview of the major
categories and tools:

### Chatbots (Scenario I in this course)

General-purpose AI assistants accessed via web interface:

| Tool | Provider | Key Features |
|------|----------|--------------|
| [Duck.ai](https://duck.ai) | DuckDuckGo | Privacy-focused, no account needed, free |
| [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) | OpenAI | GPT-4, web browsing, code interpreter |
| [Claude](https://claude.ai) | Anthropic | Large context window, artifacts |
| [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) | Google | Multimodal, Google integration |

:::{admonition} Recommended for exercises: Duck.ai
:class: tip

For the exercises in this course, we recommend [Duck.ai](https://duck.ai) by
DuckDuckGo. DuckDuckGo is known for its privacy-first philosophy—their search
engine doesn't track users, and this extends to their AI chat service.

**Why Duck.ai for learning:**
- **No account required**: Start immediately without signup
- **Privacy by design**: Your IP address is hidden from AI providers, chats
  are not used for training, and conversations are stored locally on your
  device (not on remote servers)
- **Free access**: Includes Claude, GPT-4o mini, Llama, and Mistral models
- **Anonymous**: DuckDuckGo proxies your requests so AI providers never see
  your identity

This makes it ideal for experimenting with AI coding assistance without
creating accounts or worrying about data retention policies. You can also
access it via [duckduckgo.com/chat](https://duckduckgo.com/chat) or by typing
`!ai` in DuckDuckGo search.

### IDE-integrated assistants (Scenario II)

**TODO: This section needs expanding with more tools**

Tools that integrate directly into your development environment:

| Tool | Pricing | Key Features |
|------|---------|--------------|
| GitHub Copilot | €XX/mo (free tier available) | Most mature, broad language support |
| Amazon Q Developer | Free for individuals | AWS expertise, security scanning |
| Codeium | Free core features | 70+ languages, Windsurf IDE |
| Tabnine | Free basic tier | Privacy-focused, local models available |

**How IDE-integrated AI assistant works:**
```
+------------------+          +------------------+
|    Your IDE      |  <---->  | Remote AI Server |
| (with extension) |          | (processes your  |
|                  |          |  code context)   |
+------------------+          +------------------+
```

### Agentic coding tools (Scenario III)

**TODO: this recently changed in early february so it needs to be updated**

Autonomous agents that can write, test, and modify code:

| Tool | Provider | Key Features |
|------|----------|--------------|
| Claude Code | Anthropic | CLI-based, git integration, sandboxing |
| OpenAI Codex | OpenAI | CLI-based, git integration, sandboxing |
| GitHub Copilot Workspace | GitHub | PR-based workflow |
| Cursor | Cursor Inc. | AI-native IDE with agent mode |
| Aider | Open source | Terminal-based, multiple model support |


**How coding with agentic tools work:**
```
+--------+   high-level task   +------------+
|  You   | ------------------> |   Agent    |
|        |                     |            |
+--------+                     +-----+------+
                                     |
         +---------------------------+---------------------------+
         |                           |                           |
         v                           v                           v
  +-----------+              +-----------+              +-----------+
  | Read/Edit |              |   Run     |              |   Git     |
  |   Files   |              |  Commands |              | Operations|
  +-----------+              +-----------+              +-----------+
```

:::{admonition} The full spectrum is actually much broader
:class: note

These three scenarios are a teaching simplification. In reality, AI coding
tools exist on a spectrum with many hybrids: PR-native agents, review bots,
orchestration tools, local-first options, and more. See {doc}`appendix-spectrum`
for an extended taxonomy.
:::


## Current adoption and trends

**TODOO: ADD HERE STATS ON ADOPTION AND TRENDS**

## Limitations to keep in mind

Before diving into specific scenarios, remember these fundamental limitations:

### What LLMs cannot do

A typical generative AI system based on LLMs, without `toolcall` capabilities, cannot:

1. **Verify their own output**: They cannot run code or check if it works.
2. **Access real-time information**: Knowledge is frozen at training cutoff
3. **Understand your specific context**: They don't know your data, infrastructure, or requirements unless you tell them
4. **Guarantee correctness**: They optimize for "plausible" not "correct"

### Common failure modes

- **Hallucinated packages**: Suggesting libraries that don't exist
- **Outdated APIs**: Using deprecated functions or old syntax
- **Subtle bugs**: Code that looks right but has edge-case failures
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Not considering injection, authentication, etc.

:::{exercise} Exercise: Explore an AI chatbot
Go to [duck.ai](https://duck.ai) (no account needed) and try the following:

1. Ask: "Write a Python function to calculate the standard deviation of a list"
2. Look at the response. Does it:
   - Use a built-in library or implement from scratch?
   - Handle edge cases (empty list, single element)?
   - Include documentation?

3. Now ask: "What assumptions does this code make? What could go wrong?"
:::

:::{solution}
The exercise demonstrates several things:
- AI can generate working code quickly
- The code may not match your specific needs (maybe you wanted NumPy, or maybe you wanted the formula from scratch)
- Follow-up questions help identify limitations
- You should always review and test AI-generated code
:::


## Summary

In this section, we covered the foundations of AI-assisted coding:

- LLMs generate code by predicting tokens based on patterns learned from training data
- Open datasets like The Stack provide transparent training data for code models
- Tools range from simple chatbots to fully autonomous agents
- Understanding limitations is crucial for responsible use

:::{keypoints}
- LLMs are pattern-matching systems trained on billions of lines of code
- Training data (like The Stack) influences what models know and how they behave
- Tools range from chatbots (high control) to agents (low control)
- Always verify AI-generated code, as models cannot guarantee correctness
